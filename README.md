# Code Explanation

This is a front page template of a custom theme. 
### Client Requirement: 
Our clients changes their requirement rapidly, be it design or features. As the client is building this product as a MVP, to get along with the fastest timeline and optimal solution we have used the following steps that minimises development, testing and deployment cycle.

### Development Strategy
* We have kept the homepage file name front-page.php as it has most precedence on wordpress and also per client requirement.
* Some of the images are being rendered from theme folder as an optimization plugin used by client removes the images every now and then. 
* In some section inline style also was used to override the theme styles. 
* Meta Query and wordpress loop also used to fetch course data and show realtime course availability and price conversion to customers.
